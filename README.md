## Introduction
- Game tracker is a web-based application created as a group project by students of 100devs.
- This is designed using the MVC architecture with the 'authorization' so users can sign up and create a personal database to keep track of their backlogged and upcoming games.

## How to use the application? 
- After logging in using the username and passwords, users can add the game with 5 different properties including title, console, genre, rating and the default user ID.

- Once entered, users can have their own game library with a random generator suggesting the next game to play based on the genre and the assigned score.
